### Assignment: Exploring Python String Methods

#### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to practice and understand various string methods in Python. You will be given a set of tasks to manipulate and analyze strings using different methods.

#### Instructions:
Complete the tasks below by writing Python code that performs the required operations. For each task, ensure your code prints the expected output.

#### Tasks:

1. **Concatenation and Repetition**
   - Create two strings, `str1` and `str2`, with the values `"Hello"` and `"World"` respectively.
   - Concatenate these strings with a space in between and print the result.
   - Repeat the concatenated string 3 times and print the result.

2. **Indexing and Slicing**
   - Use the string `"Hello, World!"` for this task.
   - Print the first character.
   - Print the last character.
   - Print the substring from index 7 to the end of the string.
   - Print the substring from the start of the string to index 5.

3. **String Case Conversion**
   - Convert the string `"python programming"` to all uppercase and print the result.
   - Convert the string `"PYTHON PROGRAMMING"` to all lowercase and print the result.
   - Convert the string `"python programming"` to title case and print the result.

4. **Trimming Whitespaces**
   - Use the string `"   Welcome to Python!   "` for this task.
   - Trim the leading and trailing whitespaces and print the result.

5. **String Replacement**
   - Replace the word `"World"` with `"Python"` in the string `"Hello, World!"` and print the result.

6. **Splitting and Joining Strings**
   - Split the string `"apple, banana, cherry"` by the comma `,` and print the resulting list.
   - Join the list `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` into a single string with commas separating the items and print the result.

7. **Finding Substrings**
   - Find and print the index of the first occurrence of the substring `"World"` in the string `"Hello, World! Hello, everyone!"`.
   - Count and print the number of times the substring `"Hello"` appears in the same string.

8. **String Checking Methods**
   - Check if the string `"Python123"` is alphanumeric and print the result.
   - Check if the string `"12345"` contains only digits and print the result.
   - Check if the string `"   "` contains only whitespace and print the result.

9. **String Formatting**
   - Use the variables `name` and `age` with values `"Alice"` and `30` respectively.
   - Print the string `"My name is Alice and I am 30 years old."` using the `format()` method.
   - Print the same string using an f-string.

#### Submission:
Submit your Python script file containing the solutions to the tasks above.
